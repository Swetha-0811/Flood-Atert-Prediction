Here’s a clean, ready-to-use README.md for your GitHub repository based on the project structure you uploaded (app.py + templates/index.html).
Feel free to paste this directly into your GitHub repo or ask me to tailor it further (add badges, screenshots, architecture diagram, API docs, etc.).

Flood Risk Prediction Web App

This project is a simple web application designed to estimate flood risk based on user-provided environmental inputs. It uses a lightweight backend (Python/Flask) and an HTML frontend to collect input and display results.

🚀 Features

User-friendly web interface for entering environmental parameters

Backend logic to compute flood risk

Real-time risk prediction displayed on the webpage

Designed for easy deployment and customization

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flood-risk.git
cd flood-risk

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

Make sure Flask is installed:

pip install flask

4. Run the Application
python app.py


Then open your browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

🧠 How It Works

The user enters relevant input values (e.g., rainfall, soil type, elevation, etc.).

app.py processes the inputs using a simple risk-calculation algorithm or ML model (if added).

The result is sent back to the frontend and displayed instantly.

📌 Future Improvements

Add a machine learning model for more accurate predictions

Deploy using Docker or Render/Heroku

Add data visualizations

Improve UI using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS
